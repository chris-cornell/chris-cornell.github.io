      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>A couple months back, halfway into my first semester at Temple, I found myself in doubt. The first Computer Science class I registered for was CIS 1166 - “Mathematical Concepts in Computing I” - a Discrete Math course. Every section of CIS 1001, the intended introductory CS course, was full by my orientation date, and I had tested out of the first programming class, CIS 1068. This landed me in a classroom full of thick-bearded upperclassmen on my first day of college.</p>

<p>For the first two weeks of class, I watched in horror as the 24-person roster diminished over the first two weeks to a mere 8 survivors. I found myself lost, anxious, and uncertain about my choice of major.</p>

<p>I reached out and asked for advice from a family member, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate, who took the time to give me a detailed response in which he emphasized one key goal: Make a website and use it wisely. He mentioned that to manage his own site, he runs Jekyll on a Linux VM. I thanked him and stored the advice for when I could give this new project the focus and dedication it needed. After all, I had never worked with Ruby or GitHub in the past, so this was going to be a completely new experience for me.</p>

<p>Two mornings ago, I woke up early, grabbed a large coffee and a breakfast sandwich, and sat down in my dorm with caffeine-fueled determination. I was not going to get up until I had a functioning, attractive site up and running on Github Pages. With something such as Jekyll, this should be an easy setup.</p>

<p>Or so I thought.</p>

<p>Getting Jekyll itself set up was easy enough. I created a local directory, initialized it as a GitHub repo via “git init”, cloned it to my computer, and installed Ruby (which I have never used before). After installing the necessary gems to run Jekyll on GitHub Pages, I was ready to generate the Jekyll files and view my fancy new site, and it worked! My site was fully functional on the default Jekyll theme. It took a few more commits to the ‘master’ branch to get to this point.</p>

<p>The problems began here: I was not a fan of the basic theme. One of the key features of Jekyll is the customization options available to the user, so a change in theme shouldn’t have been a difficult task - but it was. After some digging around, I found multiple sources from ~6 months ago claiming that GitHub Pages support is limited, and that when hosting on GitHub pages, there are only a few <a href="https://pages.github.com/themes/">supported themes</a> available. After browsing through the list, I decided on the “minimal” theme. As per the documentation, I changed my Gemfile to include “gem jekyll-theme-minimal”, and adjusted my config.yml accordingly. Jekyll is amazing, I thought to myself! I went to update my gems via “bundle install”, and lo and behold, my first roadblock presented itself.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Installing ffi 1.9.18 (x64-mingw32)
Gem::RuntimeRequirementNotMetError: ffi requires Ruby version &lt; 2.5, &gt;= 2.0. The
current ruby version is 2.5.0.
An error occurred while installing ffi (1.9.18), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install ffi -v '1.9.18'` succeeds before bundling.

In Gemfile:
  github-pages was resolved to 172, which depends on
    github-pages-health-check was resolved to 1.3.5, which depends on
      typhoeus was resolved to 0.8.0, which depends on
        ethon was resolved to 0.11.0, which depends on
          ffi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Annoying, but not a huge issue, right? Seems like the most recent version of ffi had not yet been updated for Ruby 2.5. Nothing a Google search can’t solve. Upon some more digging, I found a <a href="https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/598">GitHib issue on the ffi repo</a> in which multiple users mentioned the same issue; Not all of the users had issues specifically while configuring Jekyll, but one or two did. A solution was posted to install ffi using the -f flag, in which users replied that it had worked. Perfect! So I went to manually force-install ffi, despite the incompatibility with the most recent version of Ruby.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gem install ffi -f
ERROR: While executing gem ... (ArgumentError) wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I scratched my head in confusion. The <a href="https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/598#issuecomment-354892346">comment that gave this solution</a> had 25 thumbs up emojis <em>and</em> 8 heart emojis - it had to work! This time, my Google-fu lead me nowhere. I decided to move to my laptop, and installed an older version of Ruby, cloned my repo, and went to work.</p>

<p>As if a sign from above, I then stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages">this GitHub blog post</a>, announcing support for any GitHub hosted Jekyll theme.</p>
