      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>A couple months back, halfway into my first semester at Temple, I found myself in doubt. The first Computer Science class I registered for was CIS 1166 - “Mathematical Concepts in Computing I” - a Discrete Math course. Every section of CIS 1001, the intended introductory CS course, was full by my orientation date, and I had tested out of the first programming class, CIS 1068. This landed me in a classroom full of thick-bearded upperclassmen on my first day of college.</p>

<p>For the first two weeks of class, I watched in horror as the 24-person roster diminished over the first two weeks to a mere 8 survivors. I found myself lost, anxious, and uncertain about my choice of major.</p>

<p>I reached out and asked for advice from a family member, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate, who took the time to give me a detailed response in which he emphasized one key goal: Make a website and use it wisely. He mentioned that to manage his own site, he runs Jekyll on a Linux VM. I thanked him and stored the advice for when I could give this new project the focus and dedication it needed. After all, I had never worked with Ruby or GitHub in the past, so this was going to be a completely new experience for me.</p>

<p>Two mornings ago, I woke up early, grabbed a large coffee and a breakfast sandwich, and sat down in my dorm with caffeine-fueled determination. I was not going to get up until I had a functioning, attractive site up and running on GitHub Pages. With something such as Jekyll, this should be an easy setup.</p>

<p>Or so I thought.</p>

<p>Getting Jekyll itself set up was easy enough. I created a local directory, initialized it as a GitHub repo via “git init”, cloned it to my computer, and installed Ruby (which I have never used before). After installing the necessary gems to run Jekyll on GitHub Pages, I was ready to generate the Jekyll files and view my fancy new site, and it worked! My site was fully functional on the default Jekyll theme. It took a few more commits to the ‘master’ branch to get to this point.</p>

<p>The problems began here: I was not a fan of the basic theme. One of the key features of Jekyll is the customization options available to the user, so a change in theme shouldn’t have been a difficult task - but it was. After some digging around, I found multiple sources from ~6 months ago claiming that GitHub Pages support is limited, and that when hosting on GitHub pages, there are only a few <a href="https://pages.github.com/themes/">supported themes</a> available. After browsing through the list, I decided on the “minimal” theme. As per the documentation, I changed my Gemfile to include “gem jekyll-theme-minimal”, and adjusted my config.yml accordingly. Jekyll is amazing, I thought to myself! I went to update my gems via “bundle install”, and lo and behold, my first roadblock presented itself.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Installing ffi 1.9.18 (x64-mingw32)
Gem::RuntimeRequirementNotMetError: ffi requires Ruby version &lt; 2.5, &gt;= 2.0. The
current ruby version is 2.5.0.
An error occurred while installing ffi (1.9.18), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install ffi -v '1.9.18'` succeeds before bundling.

In Gemfile:
  github-pages was resolved to 172, which depends on
    github-pages-health-check was resolved to 1.3.5, which depends on
      typhoeus was resolved to 0.8.0, which depends on
        ethon was resolved to 0.11.0, which depends on
          ffi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Annoying, but not a huge issue, right? Seems like the most recent version of ffi had not yet been updated for Ruby 2.5. Nothing a Google search can’t solve. Upon some more digging, I found a <a href="https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/598">GitHib issue on the ffi repo</a> in which multiple users mentioned the same issue; Not all of the users had issues specifically while configuring Jekyll, but one or two did. A solution was posted to install ffi using the -f flag, in which users replied that it had worked. Perfect! So I went to manually force-install ffi, despite the incompatibility with the most recent version of Ruby.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gem install ffi -f
ERROR: While executing gem ... (ArgumentError) wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I scratched my head in confusion. The <a href="https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/598#issuecomment-354892346">comment that gave this solution</a> had 25 thumbs up emojis <em>and</em> 8 heart emojis - it had to work! This time, my Google-fu lead me nowhere. I decided to move the party to my laptop, and installed an older version of Ruby, cloned my repo, and went to work.</p>

<p>As if a sign from above, I then stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages">this GitHub blog post</a>, announcing support for any GitHub hosted Jekyll theme. The steps were supposedly simple, even moreso than before - just add “/$theme_creator/$theme_name” to the config.yml file and rebuild your site, and voila!</p>

<p>However, yet again, simplicity was not in the plans for GitHub Pages today. I built my site locally (via “bundle exec jekyll serve”) and navigated to localhost:4000 in Chrome. Nothing. Blank page.
In the terminal sat this monstrosity:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you don't have jekyll-remote-theme or one of its dependencies installed.
In order to use Jekyll as currently configured, you'll need to install this gem. The full error message from Ruby is: 'Could not open library 'libcurl': The specified module could not be found.
Could not open library 'libcurl.dll': The specified module could not be found.
Could not open library 'libcurl.so.4': The specified module could not be found.
Could not open library 'libcurl.so.4.dll': The specified module could not be found.'
If you run into trouble, you can find helpful resources at https://jekyllrb.com/help/!
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Another dependency error, but this time more confusing: Upon running “curl –version”, I got a nice clean output informing me that Curl was not only installed, but up to date. Back to Google I went, looking for any way out of this headache. <em>I should have just used WordPress</em>, I thought to myself, skimming over the search results looking for anything relevant. I found <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6660#issuecomment-354690545">this</a> suggestion to use an older version of the github-pages plugin, which only gave me more incompatibility errors. After a while of Googling around, I found <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme/issues/17#issuecomment-354677407">this</a> suggestion to move manually extract libcurl.dll from the libcurl installation package, add it to PATH, and copy it to another “libcurl” file, sans .dll extension.</p>

<p>Finally, my page built locally. http://localhost:4000 has never looked so great. I pushed the changes to the master branch, and went to visit my live website.</p>

<p>I was greeted with a cold blank page. <em>Maybe</em>, I thought, <em>it’s just the theme</em>. So I went to install minimal-mistakes using their <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/">QuickStart Guide</a>. Again, blank page. I figured that I had now stumbled upon a layout issue, so I cloned the minimal-mistakes repository and moved all the files over. It worked - upon running the local Jekyll server, everything looked great. Now, back to the live site.</p>

<p>Instead of a blank page, I was now greeted with a boring page lacking any CSS whatsoever. I was dumbstruck - how could my page be building perfectly when running it locally, and completely break when moved to GitHub? I went back to Google and found <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/76">this</a> GitHub issue. Upon changing “https” to “http” in the ‘url’ section of my config, I crossed my fingers and pushed the changes.</p>

<p>Like magic, everything was live and functioning perfectly. It was now two days after I had originally started the project, and I finally had my site up and running. A success in my book.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
