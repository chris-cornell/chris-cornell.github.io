A couple months back, halfway into my first semester at Temple, I found myself in doubt. The first Computer Science class I registered for was CIS 1166 - "Mathematical Concepts in Computing I" - a Discrete Math course. Every section of CIS 1001, the intended introductory CS course, was full by my orientation date, and I had tested out of the first programming class, CIS 1068. This landed me in a classroom full of thick-bearded upperclassmen on my first day of college.

For the first two weeks of class, I watched in horror as the 24-person roster diminished over the first two weeks to a mere 8 survivors. I found myself lost, anxious, and uncertain about my choice of major.

I reached out and asked for advice from a family member, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate, who took the time to give me a detailed response in which he emphasized one key goal: Make a website and use it wisely. He mentioned that to manage his own site, he runs Jekyll on a Linux VM. I thanked him and stored the advice for when I could give this new project the focus and dedication it needed.

Two mornings ago, I woke up early, grabbed a coffee and a breakfast sandwich, and sat down in my dorm with caffeine-fueled determination. I was not going to get up until I had a functioning, attractive site up and running on Github Pages. With Jekyll, this should have been a quick setup.

Or so I thought.
