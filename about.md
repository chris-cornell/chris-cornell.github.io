20 year old Information Science & Technology student, currently a part-time Full Stack JS intern at [Habitat Logistics](tryhabitat.com). Some other interests of mine include video games (specifically Counter Strike), reading, writing, fashion, music and art. Striving to learn as much as I can and apply in the best way possible, and ultimately to create technological solutions that improve quality of life.

My top 3 skills are JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, and Java.

I am currently enrolled in the Temple University Honors program with an expected graduation of May 2021.
