I'm a 19 year old Computer Science student with a knack for <s>laziness</s> efficiency and automation. Some other interests of mine include video games (especially Counter Strike) and fashion. My focus is on gaining as much knowledge and experience as I can and applying it anywhere possible.

I am currently enrolled in the Temple University Honors program with an expected graduation of May 2021. 

You can contact me by email [here](mailto:chriscornell@temple.edu).
